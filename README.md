The enemies have two prototypes, such as the <strong>update</strong> which update the locations of bugs and <strong>render</strong>which draws the bugs. In addition, the update function also deals with the situtation when the player hits a bug. The player has two prototypes, such as <strong>update</strong> and <strong>render</strong>, which have the same functionalities as the enemies. It also has Inputhandler that receives the key input from the users and directs the character's movements.
